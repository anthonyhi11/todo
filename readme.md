# TODO list

An ongoing project with vanilla js to get a better understanding of what the browser is doing and how to work with it to achieve a great experience for the user.

Additionally, I want to be able to really dive into building more complex applications with just vanillajs. it's fun to learn about the tradeoffs and understand why frameworks offer the abstractions they do and how I can leverage those better on client projects. A great understanding of what's going on under the hood is absolutely necessary.

Who knows... maybe I'll make my own framework or library to handle that?

## future features

- mobile friendly
- style (jamie is working on this for me)
